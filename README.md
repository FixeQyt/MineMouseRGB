# MineMouseRGB

MineMouseRGB is a Minecraft Fabric mod and Python backend that allows you to synchronize your mouse RGB lighting with in-game events and dimensions. The mod communicates with a local Python server using OpenRGB to control the colors of your mouse LEDs in real time.

## Features

- **Dynamic LED Colors:** Change mouse LED colors based on Minecraft dimension (Overworld, Nether, End) or game state (menu, damage).
- **Blink on Damage:** Mouse blinks red when the player takes damage.
- **Automatic Color Restore:** Restores your original mouse colors when the game closes.
- **Customizable:** Easily extendable for more events or devices.

## How It Works

- The Minecraft mod (Java, Fabric) listens for in-game events and sends HTTP requests to a local Python FastAPI server.
- The Python server uses OpenRGB to control your mouse LEDs.

## Requirements

- **Minecraft 1.20+** with [Fabric Loader](https://fabricmc.net/)
- **Python 3.8+**
- [OpenRGB](https://openrgb.org/) running in SDK mode
- Supported RGB mouse

## Installation

### 1. Python Backend

1. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install fastapi uvicorn openrgb-python
    ```
2. Start OpenRGB in SDK mode:
    ```bash
    OpenRGB --server
    ```
3. Run the backend server:
    ```bash
    uvicorn mouse_color:router --host 127.0.0.1 --port 6969
    ```

### 2. Minecraft Mod

1. Build the mod using Gradle:
    ```bash
    ./gradlew build
    ```
2. Place the generated JAR file in your Minecraft `mods` folder.
3. Launch Minecraft with Fabric.

## Configuration

- The mod automatically detects and controls the first mouse device found by OpenRGB.
- **Currently, this project only supports my ROCCAT Burst Pro mouse.**
- **In my setup, the LEDs are indexed as follows:**
    - `0` - Scroll Wheel
    - `1` - Logo
- In the future, I plan to add more features and support for additional LEDs and devices.

## Usage

- **Menu:** Mouse logo is set to menu color.
- **Overworld/Nether/End:** Mouse logo changes color based on the current dimension.
- **Damage:** Mouse logo blinks red when the player is hurt.
- **Shutdown:** Original colors are restored when Minecraft closes.

## Troubleshooting

- Make sure OpenRGB is running in SDK mode before starting the backend.
- Ensure your mouse is supported by OpenRGB.
- The backend must be running on `localhost:6969` for the mod to communicate.
